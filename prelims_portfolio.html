			<h3>Research Program</h3>
      <p>My research interests include technology adoption; user beliefs, attitudes, and motivation; mental models and education; and usability. For a broad overview and summary of my published and work in progress, as well as work that I plan to do, please read my <a href="ResearchStatement.pdf">research statement</a> here.</p>
      <h3>Integration Skills</h3>
      <p>Competent researchers must be able to bridge and integrate disparate bodies of work and make new connections. I believe that my work shows this capability, and offer this <a href="NSFProposal.pdf">sample grant proposal</a> as an example.</p>
      <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
      <p>I believe that education is a key responsibility for human factors professionals wherever they find themselves. My experience as an instructor has shaped my <a href="TeachingPhilosophy.pdf">teaching philosophy</a> around principles that have proven effective.</p>

			<h3>Service as Reviewer</h3>
      <p>I reviewed a submission to the journal <em>Human Factors</em> under the supervision of Dr. Gillan through the student reviewer program. We read and reviewed the manuscript independently, and discussed our process and considerations together afterwards. I have also served as a judge for the Undergraduate Research Symposium at NCSU in 2016, and reviewed submissions to the Southeastern Human Factors Applied Research Conference in 2017.</p>
      <h3>Service in Student Organizations</h3>
      <p>I served as the HFES Student Chapter president during my first year in the HFAC program at NCSU. I also served the HFE (now HFAC) area representative for GrASP. as well as the HFES Student Chapter president, during my first year in the program.</p>
